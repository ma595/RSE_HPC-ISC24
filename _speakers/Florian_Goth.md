Specializing into harnessing the power of modern massively parallel computer systems, I support users at all levels of program development: Algorithmic development coupled with low-level hardware optimization, writing and maintaining the actual code, as well as striving to implement sustainable software development models in science.

As part of the KONWIHR Basis project "Monte Carlo simulations of topological quantum matter" I work closely with NHR@FAU to support users to run simulations from the domain of solid state physics on NHR@FAU's hardware, while I'm working towards the digitalization of science in Würzburg as part of the deRSE chapter Würzburg.
