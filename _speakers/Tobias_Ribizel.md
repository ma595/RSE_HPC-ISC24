Tobias is a PhD student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) working on the intersection of HPC for sparse linear algebra and sustainable software engineering as part of the core development team for the Ginkgo software library. Working on a high-quality software library requires a lot of tinkering with build and CI tooling, some of which will be the focus of his contribution to the workshop.
