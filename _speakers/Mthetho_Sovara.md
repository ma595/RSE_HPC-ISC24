Fascinated by the intricate interplay between the ocean and atmosphere, particularly within the southern African context, my current research revolves around leveraging disruptive technologies such as high-performance computing (HPC), accelerators, and data-driven machine learning. These tools are instrumental in advancing numerical climate modelling and weather prediction, and pivotal in addressing urgent climate change challenges. My primary goal is to delve into the dynamic nuances of the ocean-atmosphere system and develop predictive tools to forecast its behaviour. Moreover, I have been deeply involved in supporting Space Science codes within my professional domain.
Beyond my research, I actively participate in several high-performance computing (HPC) initiatives geared towards assisting postgraduate students from universities across Southern Africa. My responsibilities extend to outreach programs and online courses, where we provide comprehensive training in coding fundamentals and advanced software/hardware programming. These educational endeavors cater to a diverse audience, spanning from high school students to seasoned professionals, hailing from various regions within South Africa and across the African continent.
