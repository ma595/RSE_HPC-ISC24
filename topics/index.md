## Topics of interest 
During the workshop we would like to address some of the following questions and topics. This list is not conclusive and we welcome submissions with a different focus.

- Topic 1: What role do large communities like ‘RSE’ play? 
One could argue that smaller communities dedicated to specific application areas or specialised technical focus like RSE are more useful in a technical sense - what role do broader communities have?  
- Topic 2: What are the best ways to enable integration of HPC and RSE communities?
What scale of community is regarded as most suitable for a given field or subfield? Do individuals prefer to meet in local groups or have a bigger community as an umbrella group, or both? 
How does a subgroup such as HPC software engineers not get lost in a larger group like RSE? 
- Topic 3: How do we manage the intersection between different technical communities within the HPC community and relate to the wider networks?
A typical HPC team does not only consist of software engineers, but also of system administrators or system engineers. How does the existence of an RSE community avoid splitting an HPC team, and succeed in enhancing it instead? 
Do special interest groups, such as CaRRC and HPC-SIG already provide a solution to this question?
- Topic 4: How can we improve diversity in the HPC community? 
What can existing communities do better to aid early career professionals? How can we reach a more diverse field of people, and encourage and support them to take up a career in our field? How can we work together with initiatives and organisations such as Women in HPC? 
- Topic 5: Career paths, does one name make it easier? Or is it a local/organisation problem in general.
What can we learn from the history of the RSE movement? Why do we still discuss career paths more than 12 years on?
- Topic 6: Training opportunities within the community or outside.
Which training opportunities should we be aware of? Which are missing?
