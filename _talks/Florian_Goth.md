The main objective of KONWIHR is to provide technical support for the use of high-performance computers and to expand their deployment potential through research and development projects. Close cooperation between disciplines, users, and participating computer centers as well as efficient transfer and fast application of the results are important.
KONWIHR facilitates this mission by providing HPC support via their HPC specialists at the HPC centers
and is reaching out to domain researchers onsite via dedicated Basis projects. 
The Basis projects support scientists in their activities anfd uphold the best practices of Research Software Engineering
in order to develop sustainable software projects.
