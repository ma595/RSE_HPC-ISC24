This talk explores the pivotal role of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Research Software Engineering (RSE) in driving socio-economic and scientific progress across Africa. As the continent grapples with a myriad of challenges, ranging from healthcare and agriculture to climate change and urbanization, harnessing the power of HPC and RSE has emerged as a promising avenue for transformative change. Drawing on case studies and best practices, this presentation highlights the symbiotic relationship between HPC and RSE, emphasizing their collaborative potential in addressing Africa's most pressing issues. Moreover, it discusses capacity building initiatives, challenges, and opportunities for fostering greater collaboration and knowledge exchange within the HPC and RSE communities in Africa.
