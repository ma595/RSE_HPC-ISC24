As part of the Workshop track at ISC24 (International Supercomputing Conference) we are looking for speakers in two categories:
Early career speaker*: We are looking for  early career RSE or HPC engineers or students that could share their experience when entering the RSE/HPC community or how a story how a collaboration was possible because of the community aided in achieving a community goal (training, collaboration)
Talks Session 2: Career Paths and training formats: We are looking for individuals that can talk about specific career paths in the RSE/HPC community or training formats/platforms. 

Do you have a story to tell how the RSE/HPC community helped improve a project for example by finding collaboration partners or offering training? Or have you been involved in developing a training course or establishing career paths?
