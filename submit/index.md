As part of the Workshop track at ISC24 (International Supercomputing Conference) we are looking for 10 min presentations:
- Early career speaker**: We are looking for early career RSE or HPC engineers or students who could share their experiences entering the RSE/HPC community or a story of how a collaboration/project was made possible because of community involvement. 
- Career Paths and training formats: We are looking for individuals who can talk about specific career paths in the RSE/HPC community or training formats/platforms. 
- Experiences in connecting HPC+RSE in projects. 

Details: Please submit a title and short abstract (up to 250 words). Abstracts for all accepted talks will be published with the workshop schedule.

We are looking forward to seeing you at the HPC-RSE workshop at ISC24 in Hamburg.

We specifically encourage submissions from early career speakers, i.e. typically within 5 years of graduation or have recently undergone a career change. RSEHPC@ISC24 will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere, and we encourage proposals from a diverse range of backgrounds.
