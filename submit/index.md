As part of the Workshop track at ISC24 (International Supercomputing Conference) we are looking for speakers in two categories:
Early career speaker: We are looking for  early career RSE or HPC engineers or students that could share their experience when entering the RSE/HPC community or how a story how a collaboration was possible because of the community aided in achieving a community goal (training, collaboration)
Talks Session 2: Career Paths and training formats: We are looking for individuals that can talk about specific career paths in the RSE/HPC community or training formats/platforms. 

Do you have a story to tell how the RSE/HPC community helped improve a project for example by finding collaboration partners or offering training? Or have you been involved in developing a training course or establishing career paths? 


You can use the form below to propose a talk or poster to be presented at HPCRSE-ISC24
The deadline for submissions is **17 May 2024**.
Each attendee may only give one talk.

HPCRSE-ISC24 will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere, and we encourage proposals from a diverse range of backgrounds.
If you have any questions about submitting a talk, feel free to contact [Stefanie Reuter (submissions@hpcrse-isc24.org)](mailto:submissions@hpcrse-isc24.org)).
