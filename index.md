Communities grow and develop, in part, due to the training, career paths and outreach that they provide. But communities seem to exist at many different levels even when they share commonalities. For instance, High Performance Computing (HPC) specialisation is often a relatively distinct subgrouping within the wider Research Software Engineering (RSE) community. Similarly, RSE can also be considered a distinct subgroup within the wider HPC community. In different countries, this can lead to different ways of sharing expertise and experience between the general RSE and HPC groups. 

In this workshop we will explore the characteristics and approaches to this sharing, with the aim to understand what lessons can be learned to ensure both groups can mutually benefit from each other.  

We will hear from individuals who have established roles in HPC and RSE communities as well as speakers who are new to the RSE/HPC community. In addition, we have invited a speaker to share experiences of building HPC-RSE communities in Africa. The workshop will be concluded by a panel discussion on diversity, career paths, training opportunities and the dynamic relationship between RSE and HPC communities. 

## Talk submissions. 

To present a talk at RSEHPC@ISC24 use the [form on the Talk submission page](/RSE_HPC-ISC24/submit/). RSEHPC@ISC24 will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere and we encourage proposals from a diverse range of areas and backgrounds.

The deadline for submissions is **29 Feb 2024**
